You MUST use the endpoint address in all steps below. The normal www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com won't work - you need to use the regional version (http://www.example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

Now, we can set up the DNS to give you a clean, custom URL.

First, we will map www.example.com to your site.

Using your DNS provider's tools, (123-reg in your case) you need to create a CNAME record to map www.example.com to www.example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

The CNAME is the only thing you need if you just want www.example.com. Most people also want "example.com" to work so we need another step.

example.com is often referred to as a naked domain or the apex record of the domain. The reason it's a problem is that it can't be a CNAME. CNAMEs only work on subdomains like "www." This makes it more difficult to point at s3.

The usual approach is to use a service to automatically redirect any request going to example.com to point to www.example.com. This will then pick up your CNAME record and your site will be served from s3.

The automatic redirect is not possible with plain old DNS so you have to use another service. Some DNS providers offer this service along with their DNS (godaddy does, amazon route53 does not. Not sure about 123-reg)

If your DNS provider doesn't do it, there are a few free services. One that I've used is http://wwwizer.com/naked-domain-redirect - it doesn't require any registration or payment.

To use this type of service, you need to create a DNS "A" record for your naked domain. For the wwwizer.com service, you would need to create an A record to point example.com to 174.129.25.170. That's all!

So, with this setup, if a user types example.com into their browser, the following would happen:

DNS query: example.com -> 174.129.25.170 (wwwizer.com's service)
HTTP request to 174.129.25.170 for example.com
174.129.25.170 redirects example.com -> www.example.com
DNS query: www.example.com -> CNAME to www.example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
DNS query: www.example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com -> points to Amazon S3
HTTP request for www.example.com is now served by Amazon S3
