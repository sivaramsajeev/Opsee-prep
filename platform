By default, you can always list other users processes in Linux.

To change that, you need to mount proc in /etc/fstab with hidepid=2:

proc            /proc           proc    defaults,hidepid=2
This functionality is supported from the kernel v3.2 onwards. It hides /proc and consequentially ps activity from all users except root.
