By default, you can always list other users processes in Linux.

To change that, you need to mount proc in /etc/fstab with hidepid=2:

proc            /proc           proc    defaults,hidepid=2
This functionality is supported from the kernel v3.2 onwards. It hides /proc and consequentially ps activity from all users except root.


To check if Pdftk is already installed

sudo apt list | grep pdftk 

If output contains '[installed]' tag with pdftk then you can skip step1 i.e if the output is like this

qpdf -password=<your-password> -decrypt /path/to/secured.pdf out.pdf

    Steps to install the s3fs on Centos/RHEL/Amazon Linux
Login to EC2 Linux Server via SSH

Install required dependencies for Centos/RHEL/Amazon Linux
$ sudo yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel
1
	
$ sudo yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel

#For Ubuntu Systems

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev mime-support
1
	
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev mime-support

Now compile s3fs and install it with below command:

# git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git
# cd s3fs-fuse
# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install
1
2

5
6
	
# git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git
# cd s3fs-fuse
# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install

Step to mount S3 Bucket to Linux File System

You need root privileges, so login with root user or switch to root user:
$ sudo su
1
	
$ sudo su

Create IAM user you need access-key and secret key for s3fs, store key details in /etc/passwd-s3fs

#echo <access-key-id>:<secret-access-key> > /etc/passwd-s3fs

#chmod 600 /etc/passwd-s3fs
1
2
3
	
#echo <access-key-id>:<secret-access-key> > /etc/passwd-s3fs
 
#chmod 600 /etc/passwd-s3fs

(Replace <access-key-id> and <secret-access-key> with the actual IAM user keys)
Create Dir to mount s3bucket:

For example:
#mkdir /mnt/<test-bucket>
Add entry to fstab to mount the bucket:
echo s3fs#<s3-bucket> /mnt/<test-bucket> fuse _netdev,rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,nonempty 0 0 >> /etc/fstab
1
2
3
	
#mkdir /mnt/<test-bucket>
Add entry to fstab to mount the bucket:
echo s3fs#<s3-bucket> /mnt/<test-bucket> fuse _netdev,rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,nonempty 0 0 >> /etc/fstab

(Replace the leading <s3-bucket> with your AWS s3 bucket name and the /mnt/<test-bucket> with the mount point which you have created)

Use-mention command to mount the partition which has entered in fstab and here we just now added AWS S3 bucket details to mount on Linux:
# mount -a
1
	
# mount -a

Verify the S3 bucket mounted on Linux server

# df -h
1
	
# df -h

In the command output, you can see the bucket name which you have to add an entry in /etc/fstab.
