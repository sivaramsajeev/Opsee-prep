By default, you can always list other users processes in Linux.

To change that, you need to mount proc in /etc/fstab with hidepid=2:

proc            /proc           proc    defaults,hidepid=2
This functionality is supported from the kernel v3.2 onwards. It hides /proc and consequentially ps activity from all users except root.


To check if Pdftk is already installed

sudo apt list | grep pdftk 

If output contains '[installed]' tag with pdftk then you can skip step1 i.e if the output is like this

qpdf -password=<your-password> -decrypt /path/to/secured.pdf out.pdf
